# Executors

Newbro should expose a clean separation between:

- executor core abstractions
- concrete executor adapters

Stable core concepts:

- `Executor`
- `ExecutorSession`
- `ExecutorEvent`
- `ExecutorResult`
- `ExecutorCapabilities`
- `Executor Node`

Important capability directions:

- `supports_resume`
- `supports_follow_up`
- `supports_setup`

Current deployment direction:

- `mock` remains an in-process adapter
- real executors such as `codex` and `acpx` run inside the detached executor
  node
- the main Newbro API process registers hosted executor proxies rather than
  launching real executor subprocesses directly
- the control plane does not ask the operator to choose detached executor
  families; executor nodes declare their enabled families through
  `executor_node.enabled_executors` and live node registration

Executor-node note:

- the detached node owns live executor-native session continuity
- Newbro keeps durable execution lineage and user-facing control semantics
- executor-native continuity still remains optional across executor families
- Newbro persists an operator-managed executor-node registry, including
  node id, enabled executor families, and issued enrollment credentials
- detached nodes authenticate to Newbro with `node_id` and `token` on
  `WS /api/executors/control`
- the executor node's Newbro URL is a client-side runtime input passed to
  `newbro executor run --base-url ...`, not server-owned node metadata
- local executor-family/tool config no longer uses an `executor_node.enabled`
  toggle; `newbro executor run` may trigger the same local setup flow when
  executor commands or enabled families are missing
- each Bro may be bound to one executor node; a Bro is considered live only
  when its bound node is currently connected back to Newbro
- detached executor nodes connect to the main Newbro service origin through
  `WS /api/executors/control`
- foreground `newbro executor run` output should make connect, ready,
  disconnect, and retry state explicit, and should only report ready after the
  control-channel registration handshake succeeds

Adapter direction:

- Codex is one real adapter family
- Codex `agentMessage` commentary deltas are normalized into progress
  `ExecutorEvent`s so execution runs expose live user-facing progress through
  `latest_progress_message` snapshots without leaking Codex-native event
  shapes to clients
- OpenClaw or other executor families should fit behind the same normalized executor contract

This is why:

- `AgentResumeHandle` must stay optional
- runtime continuity and executor-native continuity must remain distinct concepts
- `session_affinity` should be treated as an opaque workspace id that the
  detached node resolves into a node-local directory
