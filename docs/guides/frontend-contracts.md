# Frontend Contracts

The frontend should depend on stable protocol projections rather than ad hoc mirrored types.

Preferred direction:

- derive shared schema from protocol models
- consume stable task/session/run/summary projections
- avoid depending on low-level executor events

User-visible conversation history should contain only:

- user messages
- assistant replies
- emitted proactive messages
